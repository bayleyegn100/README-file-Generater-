## Description 

I developed a README.me file generator, that can help my self and other web developers to generate their README file within a short time and let the users to allocate more time to devote working on the project. The application has basics elements of README file. To develop this application, I used a markdown markup language to format the elements of a file. In addition, I used node.js and a software registry and software package manager and installer called Node Package Manager (npm). 

## Motivation

## Instructions

You do not have a limitation to use this application. As you see the license section at the top of the README.me file it is an open source. If you already have the above specified tools you can start developing your readme file. First right click on the readme.js file and click on ‘open on integrated terminal’ or you can use a terminal and drag or write the file inside opened terminal. If it is going well as attached in the readme file write ‘node readme.js’ in the terminal. Hereafter the questions going to prompt and write your answer for each question. As we all know the readme file is very important part of our work. So that I recommend the plaintext of a readme to be written in a separate place and copy and paste it, instead of writing all the necessary sentences on the terminal. When you done this part you will find a read me file and open to that file and check whether all the information you provided are incorporated. If you face any problem or would like to reach me, you can find my contact in the question section.
